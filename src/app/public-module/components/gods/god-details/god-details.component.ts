He is worshipped as a powerful deity as he is the destroyer of demons and wicked people. He will be more pleased when you worship Lord Ram, his only master.</p> <p>Lord Hanuman was a passionate devotee of Lord Rama who was the seventh avatar of Lord Mahavishnu.

Due to his crazy behavior, he was cursed by a Sage to forget his magical powers when he needs them.</p> <h2>A shining exemplar in Ramayan</h2> <p>In the epic Ramayana, Lord Hanuman was one of the great companions of Lord Rama. When Lord Rama and Lakshmana went in search of Sita Devi they met Hanuman in Kishkinda forests. Lord Rama was delighted with the flawless manners, simplicity, and innocence of Hanuman. He answered Hanuman on his doubts about life. Jambavan reminded Hanuman about his ability to fly by which they found Sita. Throughout the whole episode, Lord Hanuman served as a mediator to Lord Rama and Sita Devi. When he asked Sita Devi about the significance of applying sindoor on the forehead, she replied that it is for the longevity of Lord Rama. By hearing this, Hanuman applied sindoor on his full body to present the love and an avid devotion towards Lord Rama.</p> <p>Lord Hanuman played a valiant role in the battle against Ravana and stood for the win of Lord Rama. He brought Maruthwamala ( mountain) which includes a lot of medicinal herbs to cure the wound of Lakshmana who was injured during the battle against Indrajith, the son of Ravana. This action depicts that the heart of Lord Hanuman is filled with love and admiration towards Lord Rama and Sita Devi. The divine relationship between Lord Rama and Hanuman personifies the importance of pure adoration, love, consciousness, and dedication.</p> <p>According to Hindu belief, Lord Hanuman is still immortal in this universe.

He acquired several boons from Lord Brahma with his deep meditation for several yugas. As per the boon, Hiranyakashipu could not be killed by a god, human, monster, weapon either inside or outside and not at the time of day or night.

He invoked Vishnu every time and chanted the sacred mantras of the Lord. In his mother’s womb, he heard a lot of Lord Vishnu’s stories and mantras from his mother. Hiranyakashipu was irritated with his son’s actions as the palace sounded with praise of Lord Vishnu. He decided to kill his divine son because of his affinity with Lord Vishnu. Once Hiranyakashipu asked Prahlada about Lord Vishnu, he praised Vishnu in a soulful manner and said that the presence of the supreme lord is ubiquitous. By hearing his response, Hiranyakashipu shattered the pillar with his mace in an extreme temper. Suddenly, a petrified figure came out of the hewed pillar with a thirst of diminishing him. Hiranyakashipu became mystified by seeing the unbelievable appearance of Lord Narasimha. Lord Narasimha killed the pitiless devil by taking entrails by seizing them in his lap at the time of sunset. Thus he saved little prince Prahlada and the whole universe from the uncompassionate demon. </p> <p class=text-center>Praise him, devote yourself!</p>"

        paragraph1: "<h2><i>Lord Kartikeya - Lord Shiva’s Guru</i></h2> <p>Lord Kartikeya who is the principal god of the Tamil people is popularly called Tamil Kadavul. As you would have guessed, he is also worshiped in countries closer to Tamil Nadu like Srilanka and South Asian countries like Singapore and Malaysia. He is the repository of knowledge and the source of three branches of Tamil literature as (Prose) Iyal, (Music) Isai, and (drama) Nadakam. He is also known as Lord Muruga Aarumuga and Lord Swaminatha. As per Tamil literature, the name Muruga specifies the trinities as MU - Mukundan (Vishnu), RU - Rudra (Lord Shiva), and KA - Kamalan (Brahma). The epic Skanda Purana describes how he arrived on this planet, as the naughty son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. Lord Ganesha was his elder brother. His attire includes a spear (vel), peacock as his Vahana (vehicle), and a cock banner on the other hand.  </p> <h2><i>The Guru</i></h2> <p>When he was a child, Lord Shiva told him to go to Lord Brahma for his studies. He went to Lord Brahma and asked, “What is the meaning of Om.” Lord Brahma told him to study letters first. Hearing this, he responded, “ You don’t know the meaning of Om and you are not fit to be my teacher.” Shockingly, Lord Brahma told Lord Shiva that, “I could not answer the questions of your son and please handle yourself.” Shiva was very much angry. He called his son and enquired. When Shiva realized the situation he was astonished. He requested his son for the meaning. </p> <p>Lord Karthikeya said, “ In a Gurugula, the Guru should sit at a higher place than the student.” After a smile, Lord Shiva made him sit on his shoulders. Thus the young boy taught Lord Shiva the eternal meaning of Om as “The Entire creation is Om.” Seeing this, Goddess Parvati named Lord Muruga as Lord Swaminatha (One who taught my Natha). </p> <h2><i>The Anger</i></h2> <p>One fine Morning, Sage Maratha, known in the deva world for his crazy activities, came to Kailasa to seek blessings from Lord Shiva. During the visit, he brought a mango to the children. He planned to check the unity among the children. As there was only one mango, Lord Shiva planned a competition. He said, “ The Mango will be given to the one who circles the world thrice.” Hearing this, Lord Muruga drove his peacock to start circling. But Lord Ganesha started to circle his mom and dad. He said the world is equal to Lord Shiva and Parvati. Surprisingly, the gods gave him the mango. When Lord Muruga returned he was shocked. He went to Mount Palani with anger. Sage Auvaiyar praised the Lord with her songs to reduce the anger. The devotees still sing these songs. </p> <h2><i>Unique Arpana</i></h2> <p>Tamil People are known for extreme devotion and Arpana. They would pierce spears in their tongue and shoulders during Kavadi Aatam (A dance by the devotees for Lord Muruga). Some of the famous temples for Lord Muruga in South India are in Tiruchendur, Palani, and Thiruparankundram. </p> <p>Pray Lord Muruga!, chant Harohara!! Kanthanukku Vel vel, Muruganukku vel vel!<p>"

Sri Satyanarayana Swamy is the majestic form of Lord Mahavishnu, preserver of the universe. Lord Mahavishnu's manifestation in the form of Lord Satyanarayana is to enlighten the devotees towards the path of salvation. Lord Satyanarayana will bless us with prosperity and good fortunes in our life. Satyanarayana is derived from Sanskrit in which 'Satya' means verity and 'Narayana' means the supreme being that exists in everything.</p> <p>The worship of Sri Satyanarayana Swamy is stated in Sri Satyanarayan Katha. Among the eighteen Puranas, Skanda Purana delineated about Sri Satyanarayan Katha, which consists of five stories. Sri Satyanarayan Katha includes a conversation between Narad Muni and Lord Vishnu. Lord Mahavishnu illuminated the significance of Satyanarayan puja.</p> <h2><i>Did you have the interest to know Sathyanarayan Katha? Let's have a look!!</i></h2> <p>Satyanarayan Katha starts with the narration of Maharishi Sootha in the Naimisharanya forests along with rishis. Suspiciously, Rishis asked Maharishi Sootha about the attainment of the salvation of humankind. Maharishi narrated the response of Lord Mahavishnu to Narad Muni.</p> <p>Once Narad Muni visited Mrityulok, the planet earth, and noticed that humans were suffering from their past deeds (karma). Narad Muni went to the abode of Lord Mahavishnu by witnessing the agonies of humankind on the earth. He met the Godhead Mahavishnu, who was embellished with Shanka (conch), Chakra (discus), Gadha (mace), and Padma (lotus) held in his four hands and wore an elegant garland over his neck. Narad Muni informed the Lord about the miseries faced by people on earth due to the previous life's deeds. He requested Lord Mahavishnu to lead the people to attain moksha (salvation). </p> <h2>Way to deliverance</h2> <p>Lord Mahavishnu conveyed a great solution to rescue from the sorrows of the people. Lord acknowledged that humankind could be relieved from all the sufferings by performing a puja named 'Satyanarayan Puja,' which will lead towards attaining salvation. When performed according to religious rites, this puja will bring happiness, tranquility, and wealth in life.

The great Ramayana is a matchless verse that delineates the sublimest thoughts of life. Ramayana narrates the exemplar events of Lord Rama (seventh incarnation of Lord Maha Vishnu) and Goddess Sita Devi, an avatar of Goddess Lakshmi Devi.</p> <h2><i>Lakshmana- An inevitable personification</i></h2> <p>Sri Lakshmana played a significant character throughout the great epic Ramayana. According to Hindu mythology, Sri Lakshmana is known to be an avatar of Adishesha, a thousand-headed snake on which Lord Mahavishnu rests. Sri Lakshmana is the epitome of brotherly love. Throughout the epic, we can see Lakshmana's devotion to Lord Rama. During the exile, he accompanied him by leaving his whole family that showed his utmost devotion to his elder brother Lord Rama.  He equally respects Goddess Sita Devi as his mother.</p> <h2><i>Iconology</i></h2> <p>In most of the images, Sri Lakshmana accompanied Lord Rama and Goddess Sita Devi. He is portrayed as a tranquilized personality with a smiling face. He holds an umbrella over the sacred head of Lord Rama. Lakshmana wore yellow silk with a shining crown and bespangled with gem-studded bangles. The image of Lord Rama and Goddess Sita Devi along with Sri Lakshmana is common in most of the puja rooms of Hindus. </p> <h2><i>Role in Ramayana</i></h2> <p>Lord Rama(Prince of Ayodhya), Bhatha, Lakshmana and Shatrugna were the four sons of King Dasharatha. Sri Lakshmana and Shatrughna were the twin sons born to Sumithra (third queen of Dasharatha). Being a humble personality, Lakshmana was more attached and loyal to Lord Rama. When Lord Rama was married to Goddess Sita Devi after a challenging task, Lakshmana also married the sister of Sita called Urmila. Sri Lakshmana also followed him when circumstances led Lord Rama to be exiled for fourteen years. Here we can appreciate the extreme devotion of Sri Laksmana to Lord Rama. He left his lovely wife Urmila with intense grief due to brotherly love for Rama. He obtained a boon from Nidra Devi (Goddess of sleep) to devoid of sleep for fourteen years of exile because he wanted to be the protector of Lord Rama and Goddess Sita Devi throughout the exile.</p> <p>During the exile, Rama asked Lakshmana to guard Sita to run after a deer for Sita. Demon Maricha came in disguise as a deer to move Rama from there. Maricha misled Lakshmana in Rama’s voice to stay away from Sita. Lakshmana drew a line to save Sita from peril. The line drawn by Lakshmana was called Lakshmana Rekha. As per the advice of Sita Devi, he went to search for Rama. But sadly, demon King Ravana came in disguise as a Brahmin and abducted Sita Devi. He was a great consolation for Lord Rama during the absence of Sita Devi. </p> <p>There was a great war held between Lord Rama and Demon Ravana for rescuing Sita Devi. Sri Lakshmana played a crucial role in the great battle with excellent martial skills. He killed Indrajith, the son of Ravana in the conflict. He assisted Lord Rama to restore the virtuousness in the earth.</p> <h2><i>Veneration </i></h2> <p>Sri Lakshmana is also worshipped as a deity in India. Commonly, he is idolized along with Lord Rama and Goddess Sita Devi. <b>Nalambala Darshanam,</b> a four temple darshan is famous in Kerala where devotees visit the auspicious Malayalam month of Karkidakam annually.

Among the sacred Holy Trinity, Lord Brahma is contemplated as the supreme being who is the universe's creator. He is known as Lord of Vedas as the four Vedas ascribed to Lord Brahma. It is believed that Lord Brahma creates the whole living beings. He is known by diverse names such as Vedanatha (Lord of Vedas), Pitamaha (Supreme father), Swayambhu (self-born), Hiranyagarbha (cosmic egg), Sura Jyeshta (eldest of all Lords), Chaturmukha (Lord with four faces), Gyaneshwar (Lord of Knowledge) and Prajapathi (Lord of all creatures).  </p> <p>As you know, Lord Brahma is the creator. Are you curious to know about the birth of Lord Brahma?</p> <p>There are various myths related to the birth of Lord Brahma.

Another myth stated that the birth of Lord Brahma was in a lotus flower.</p> <h2>Image of Brahma</h2> <p>According to Hindu Mythology, Lord Brahma's portrayal resembles an older man with four heads and a long beard. Unlike other deities among the Holy Trinity, he does not hold any weapons. He held tools to perform religious rituals, prayer beads, a book, and a water pot in his four hands and wore a crown. His four heads signify the four Vedas, the sacred texts of Hinduism, and he rode on a swan. However, his entire attire denotes consciousness, knowledge, and creation. The consort of Lord Brahma is Goddess Saraswati, the Goddess of speech. <p>Have you ever thought about the deity who is not worshipped? Let's analyze what the cause for it is?</p> <p>Lord Brahma is not worshipped like the other deities in the Hindu world. The importance and tales of Lord Brahma present in sacred texts. One of the popular myths was related to Brahma's curse from Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva and Brahma met with a debate regarding who among them was mightier. Lord Shiva tests Lord Brahma and Vishnu with an Agni Sthambh (burning pillar) that had no dawn and end in vision to evade the emerging war. Lord Shiva asked them to find the end of the pillar thereby decide who would win. Lord Vishnu and Brahma began their search through underworlds and skies for thousands of years. Finally, Lord Vishnu accepted the vanquish, but Brahma combined with the flower Ketaki to assert that they had found the top. Enraged by the Brahma's perfidy, Lord Shiva cursed Brahma never to be worshipped. As per the belief, this curse was the reason for the non-worshipping of Lord Brahma. </p> <p>A rare fact that the temples for Lord Brahma are very less. But in India, there is a temple named Jagat pita Brahma Mandir which is devoted to the Lord of Creation and located in the Pushkar city of Rajasthan. Every year several tourists visit this temple during Karthika Poornima's occasion (the full moon day).</p> <p>Praise Lord Brahma; he will carve your little one with the best gems in this cosmic world!!</p>"

Vishnu appeared in this manner to save the world from tremendous flooding. Manu, the first man to catch a fish, grew up to be a giant. Manu, the first man to catch a fish, saved himself from the flood by attaching his boat to the horn of the fish's head.</p><h2><i>Why was Lord Matsya Born?</i></h2><p>Brahma, Shiva, and destroyer are the primary male deities of Hinduism. Lord Vishnu is also known as the TRIMURTI. As a member of the Trinity, He has had ten incarnations. The ten Avatars or Dashavatara of Lord Vishnu forms He took when the universe was in turmoil. Vishnu had a single purpose for each of his Avatars, but they all achieved it differently. This divine purpose was to restore Dharma, righteousness and save the planet from the evils of demons and Asuras.</p><p>Matsya, which means 'Fish' in Sanskrit, was the first Avatar Vishnu of Hinduism. In Hindu mythology texts such as the Satapatha Brahmana, the great flood is mentioned. It takes place to save Manu, the first man and the most pious, and he advises him to build an enormous boat. The four-armed Lord Matsya is usually depicted as a figure with the upper body and the lower of an animal.</p><p>According to legend, during Satya Yuga, people lived their lives in a disorderly and irreligious manner. So the Gods decided to flood the earth to prepare it for renovation. Lord Vishnu had given Lord Brahma, creator, the guidelines for transforming the world. These guidelines were the Vedas. They are the four principal books of Hinduism. Lord Brahma decided that he would rest before this arduous task because he was tired from creating it. A horse-headed demon called Hayagriva (not to be confused with Lord Hayagriva, who is considered an avatar of Vishnu and a symbol for wisdom and knowledge) escaped from Brahma's nose and fled to hide in the oceans. Hayagriva also took the Vedas from him. Hayagriva, then Satyavrata, a religious king, was also a great admirer and worshipper of Lord Vishnu. He longed to meet Him.

He begged him to save it. Unfortunately, it quickly outgrew the jar he used. The fish was then transferred to a tank, river, and finally to the ocean. Vishnu revealed that the fish was Vishnu, and he told him that within seven days, a deluge would strike that would wipe out all life.</p><p>The fish told Manu that the mare living at the bottom would release a toxic flame from her mouth at Kali Yug. This fire will ignite the entire universe, Gods, constellations, and everything. The seven clouds of doomsday will then flood the earth, making it one ocean. The fish instructed Satyavrata to build an Ark to carry all medicinal herbs and seeds. He would also be accompanied by the seven saints, the serpent Vasuki, and other animals. Manu's Ark was finished as the flood approached. Manu asked Vishnu why the flood was so devastating. Matsya Vishnu replied that he was the only moral person alive and the father for future generations.</p><p>Matsya defeated Hayagriva and gave the Vedas back to Brahma. He then tied himself to Manu's Ark using Vasuki as his rope and protected them against the storms and floods. Matsya Vishnu then left Manu and the other Himalayan men to begin human civilization after the storms had passed and the water receded.</p><h2><i>Lord Matsya Temples</i></h2><p>1.

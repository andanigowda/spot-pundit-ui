                    <p>Numerology is the study of numbers in your life. It is believed that there is a divine or mystical relationship between a number and coinciding events I oneâ€™s life. The numbers can define behavior, destiny, temperament, intelligence,
                        disposition, sexuality, spirituality, and so on. It is also the study of the numerical value of the letters in words, names, and ideas. Hindu numerology has its roots in Vedic ritual symbolism and Samkhya philosophy. Samkhya means
                        number and hence enumeration. As Samkhya system enumerated 25 tattvas (categories) it is likely the philosophy came to be called Samkhya. (https://ithihas.wordpress.com/)
